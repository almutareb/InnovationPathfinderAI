            "Based on my observation, I found several papers discussing corrective retrieval augmented generation. The first one focuses on improving the robustness of generation through a proposed approach called Corrective Retrieval Augmented Generation (CRAG), while another study combines conformal prediction and global testing to provide statistical guarantees for a retrieval augmented question answering system. Lastly, a comprehensive survey was conducted highlighting the advantages and reviewing notable approaches of retrieval-augmented text generation across various NLP tasks. However, none of them explicitly mention being the 'latest' paper on the subject. Therefore, I need to check their publication dates to determine recency. Afterward, I might also want to look into Google Scholar to see if there are newer publications not yet indexed in the arXiv database.\n",
