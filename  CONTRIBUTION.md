# Contributing to The Project

We welcome contributions from everyone. To make the process as smooth as possible, please follow the guidelines below. 

## How to Contribute

### Code Contributions

1. **Creating a Branch**: For any code contribution, start by creating a branch from the main project. The branch should be named using the pattern `#issue-id short-name-to-describe-what-is-added`. This helps in linking the contributions directly to the issues they are meant to resolve.

2. **Pull Requests**: Once you've made your changes, create a pull request (PR). Please fill out the pull request template with all the required information. This includes a summary of your changes and why they are necessary.

3. **Review Process**: Every code contribution requires a review. A minimum of one maintainer must review and approve your contribution before it can be merged. This ensures quality and adherence to the project's standards. Please ensure your code is well-documented through comments and, if necessary, additional documentation files.

4. **Testing**: Your code must be tested to ensure it works as expected and does not introduce new issues.

### Reporting Issues

When reporting issues, please use the provided issue template. Your report should include:

- A clear, descriptive title
- A detailed description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Logs, if applicable
- Screenshots, if applicable

This information is crucial in diagnosing and fixing the issue you're experiencing.

### Suggestions

We're always looking for new ideas to improve our project. If you have a suggestion, please:

- Clearly describe your suggestion, including the purpose and intended outcome.
- Explain why you believe this change would be beneficial to the project.

We appreciate your contributions and look forward to collaborating with you!
